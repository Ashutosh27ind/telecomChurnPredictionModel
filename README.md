# telecomChurnPredictionModel
Build multiple logistic and tree based models and select best model to identify churners.

### Business Problem Overview:

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

### Expected Outcome:
We will be building two machine learning models at the end of the case study.
The first model will be classification model which will be able to achieve one of the two goals - to predict customers who will churn. The second model will be a regression model to identify the important features which eventually leads to customer churns.
